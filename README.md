# Chess

A simple chess application. Not completed. Most pieces do have checking in place but still need some additions:
- Institute ‘check’ support for if king is in check
- Block castle-ing for if the king is in check
- Add ability for pawn to change to another figure when reaching the endzone
- Add checkmate support
- Add stalemate support
- Show killed figures
- Add new game / reset support
- Flip between turns support on move
- Add online player support, player 1 is host
- Add computer player support
- Score tracking kept locally on machine for wins/losses
Otherwise its a starting version for now

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
